/**
 * @brief  Two-dimensional nearest-neighbor upsampling.
 * @description
 *	This implementation leverages the Bresenham approximation approach,
 *	originally devised for approximated line drawing on pixelated output
 *	devices, for the selection of the desired closest input positions.
 *	This selection process is performed independently along each feature map
 *	dimension.
 *	In each dimension, output coordinates [0, O) are mapped back to input
 *	coordinates [0, I). With respect to Bresenham, the output assumes the role
 *	of the x- and the input the role of the y-axis in drawing a line of a slope
 *	smaller than 1. The mappings of the first and last pixels, i.e. (0, 0) and
 *	(O-1, I-1) are used as anchors and are assumed to have no associated
 *	approximation errors. For intermediate mappings (o, i), we seek the nearest
 *	input index as:
 *		i = round( (I-1)/(O-1) * o )
 *	We choose to use rounding up for ties and substitute:
 *		X := O-1
 *		Y := I-1
 *	to yield:
 *		i = round( Y/X * o )
 *
 *	For a sequential stepping through the output indices [0, O-1), the
 *	corresponding sequence of input indices can be tracked along just by
 *	maintaining an approximation error. Initially, e_0 = 0. An iterative step
 *	taking o to o+1 produces the tentative error ê_{j+1} = e_j + Y/X assuming
 *	no increment of the input index. If this tentative error remains below
 *	a half, it is carried over to the next step and the input index is
 *	not changed. Otherwise, the input index is incremented and the error is
 *	discounted accordingly. This yields an iteration step as:
 *
 *		ê_{j+1} = e_j + Y/X
 *		e_{j+1} = ê_{j+1} - (ê_{j+1} < 0.5? 0 : 1)
 *		i_{j+1} = i_j     + (ê_{j+1} < 0.5? 0 : 1)
 *
 *	The fractional representation of the error can be made integer by using:
 *
 *		E_j = 2X*e_j + 2Y - X
 *
 *	yielding:
 *
 *		E_0     = 2Y - X
 *		Ê_{j+1} = E_j     + 2Y
 *		E_{j+1} = Ê_{j+1} - (Ê_{j+1} < 2Y? 0 : 2X)
 *		i_{j+1} = i_j     + (Ê_{j+1} < 2Y? 0 :  1)
 *
 *	The detour through the tentative error can be removed from the computation:
 *
 *		E_0     = 2Y - X
 *		E_{j+1} = E_j + 2Y - (E_j < 0? 0 : 2X)
 *		i_{j+1} = i_j      + (E_j < 0? 0 :  1)
 *
 *	As all E_j are sums of Y and X and only their signedness is relevant for
 *	algorithmic decisions, Y and X can initially be reduced by their greatest
 *	common divisor. Finally, observing that the only possible odd contribution
 *	to E_j comes through the initialization of E_0, it can be truncated away:
 *
 *		E_0     = floor(Y - X/2)
 *		E_{j+1} = E_j + Y - (E_j < 0? 0 : X)
 *		i_{j+1} = i_j     + (E_j < 0? 0 : 1)
